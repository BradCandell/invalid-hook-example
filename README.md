The following repository was created to demonstrate an issue where jest throws an **Invalid hook call**, but running the same code in an application works as expected.

The custom hook is intended to further simplify the `react-modal` interface.

# Steps to reproduce

## No Error

`npm start`

## Error

`npm run test`
